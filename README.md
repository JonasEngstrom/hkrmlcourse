# hkrmlcourse
A package of helper functions written specifically for the final assignment during the course [Introduction to Machine Learning at Kristianstad University](https://www.hkr.se/kurs/da568b/kursplan), fall 2021. Google Colab will be used for training some of the models, thus this repository will not contain the entire codebase for the project.

Although the package is written for the personal use of the author during the assignment, please feel free to use the code as you see fit. Note that the university, however, does not allow using other studentsâ€™ code for solving the assigment. Also, a mention in any projects using the code is always appreciated.
